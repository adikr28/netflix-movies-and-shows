# Netflix SQL Analysis

This project contains a collection of SQL queries for analyzing a Netflix dataset stored in two tables:  
- **`shows_movies.titles`** â€” metadata for movies and TV shows  
- **`shows_movies.credits`** â€” cast and crew information  

The queries cover rating analysis, genre breakdowns, country-level stats, top/bottom performers, and people (actors/directors) with notable contributions.

## ðŸš€ Usage

1. Import your Netflix dataset into the `shows_movies.titles` and `shows_movies.credits` tables.
2. Open `Netflix_SQL_Analysis.sql` in your SQL client.
3. Run queries individually or as a batch.

---

## âš  Notes
- Queries use `shows_movies.` schema prefix; remove or adjust if your schema is different.
- Some queries rely on both IMDb and TMDB scores being non-null.
- `character` is a reserved keyword in some SQL engines â€” escape or rename if needed.
